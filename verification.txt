# Thermistor Testing

Connect an NTC thermistor as described in the README, or as follows:

1. Connect both pins of the thermistor to a breadboard.
2. Connect one pin to ground.
3. Connect the other pin to 3.3V via a 10k ohm resistor.
4. Connect pin A0 between the thermistor and the 10k resistor.

Flash the temperature.ino example to a working and online device taking care
to adjust the constructor parameter to match your actual thermistor values.

Open the Particle console. The current thermistor temperature in Fahrenheit
should be reported every 5 seconds.

Using an accurate instant read digital thermometer, submerge the thermistor and
the thermometer in a cup of heated water, and a cup of ice water.  The
temperature reported on the thermometer and on the Particle console should
match within 2 degrees.

Repeat the tests above with other thermistors and other resistors.  It should
work for various other "seriesResistor" values, and various other NTC
thermistors, if the constructor parameters thermistorNominal,
temperatureNominal, and bCoef are set correctly for the given thermistor.
